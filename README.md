Simple PHP Personal Vault:

1. Create database with note_id, note_content, note_timestamp, note_user fields. Replace database name wherever necessary. 

2. Replace all values in connection.php with the [\*\*example\*\*] syntax with relevant database and folder / directory information.

3. Replace all values in logout.php with the [\*\*example\*\*] syntax with relevant folder / directory information.

4. Replace all values in index.php with the [\*\*example\*\*] syntax with relevant user login information and database name information. (it can be whatever you choose to login to your vault.)

Feel free to download the code and use however you like!
