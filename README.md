Simple PHP Personal Vault

Replace all values in connection.php with the [\*\*example\*\*] syntax with relevant database information.

Replace all values in index.php with the [\*\*example\*\*] syntax with relevant user login information. (it can be whatever you choose to login to your vault.)

Visit http://michaelpnavarro.com/personalvault/ to give it a try. Use "username" as the username, and "password" as the password.

Feel free to download the code and use however you like!
